### About the company

A Ton Greener UF will in the future be seen as an initiative for a greener world.
Today's people should look at us as a group at the forefront of the green climate change in Europe.
A Ton Greener UF will become a company for the future, together.



Within the EU there is a system of so-called emission allowances, where each emission allowance is worth one tonne of carbon dioxide. These emission rights are purchased by companies in the EU and then as many emission allowances are forfeited as the amount of tonnes of carbon dioxide released by the companies. Some companies sell their remaining allowances to other companies so that they can in turn release carbon dioxide.

Here we come in. Instead of a company selling to another, we purchase emission rights. Companies cannot release this ton of carbon dioxide and because we hold the rights to that tone and thus remain unreleased. This, in turn, leads to an increase in demand for the remaining emission rights, and thus the price of emitting.

In the near future, companies will choose a more climate-smart way to avoid buying the emission rights because they become more expensive and more expensive. In this way, even smaller players, such as ETG UF, can influence and make it more expensive for companies to emit harmful greenhouse gases, one ton at a time.
